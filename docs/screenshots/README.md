# Screenshots

Place demo screenshots and a short GIF in this folder. Keep file names simple and lowercase, for example:

- `upload-example.png`
- `analysis-result.png`
- `demo.gif`

When adding images to this repository, reference them using relative paths in Markdown, e.g.:

```markdown
![Upload example](docs/screenshots/upload-example.png)
```

Tips:
- Keep screenshots to reasonable resolution (800–1200px width) so GitHub renders them nicely.
- Prefer PNG for static screenshots and GIF/WebM for short demos.

If you want, add a `demo.gif` and I will embed it in the main README.
